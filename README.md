# E-Commerce Rebuild Project

This project is a full-stack modernization of my previous e-commerce platform, originally built with HTML, PHP, and CSS. It leverages Next.js for a fast, SEO-friendly, and dynamic frontend, paired with Django for a robust, scalable backend API.

Designed for a global audience, the platform will feature multi-language support, multi-currency transactions, and internationalization best practices to serve customers worldwide.

The architecture includes modern development standards such as Docker-based development, CI/CD pipelines, and production-ready deployment strategies, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and reliability.

Currently under active development, the final production-ready version will be hosted in a private GitLab repository.
